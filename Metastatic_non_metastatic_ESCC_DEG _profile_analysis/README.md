# Analysis of DEG profiles of Metastatic and Non-metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma samples 

#### The following repo provides the corresponding codebases used for the comparison of differential expressed gene profiles from metastatic and non-metastatic ESCC samples.

This repository has 3 files,
- Rendered PDF of R markdown + R markdown file including the codebase used for the differential gene expression analysis in metastatic ESCC samples
- Rendered PDF of R markdown + R markdown file including the codebase used for the differential gene expression analysis in non-metastatic ESCC samples
- Rendered PDF of R markdown + R markdown file including the codebase used for the comparison of differential gene expression profiles between metastatic and non-metastatic ESCC samples

As of now, only 2/3 of the analyses has been uploaded since the project is still in progress 😃.
