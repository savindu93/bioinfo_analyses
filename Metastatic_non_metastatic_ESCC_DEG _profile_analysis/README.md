# Analysis of DEG profiles of Metastatic and Non-metastatic esophageal squamous cell carcinoma (ESCC) samples 

#### ❓ Research question: What genes are primarily involved in the progression of ESCC to metastasis? 
#### 📖 Method: Differential gene expression (DGE) profiles of metastatic and non-metastatic ESCC patients of Japanese descent were determined. Utilizing the 2 DGE profiles, driver genes involved in metastasis of ESCC in Japanese ESCC patients will be identified using a rank-based and hypergeometric overlap statistical framework.

#### The following repo provides the corresponding codebases used for the comparison of differential expressed gene profiles from metastatic and non-metastatic ESCC samples.

This repository has 3 files,
- Rendered PDF of R markdown + R markdown file including the codebase used for the differential gene expression analysis in metastatic ESCC samples
- Rendered PDF of R markdown + R markdown file including the codebase used for the differential gene expression analysis in non-metastatic ESCC samples
- Rendered PDF of R markdown + R markdown file including the codebase used for the comparison of differential gene expression profiles between metastatic and non-metastatic ESCC samples

As of now, only 2/3 of the analyses has been uploaded since the project is still in progress 😃.
